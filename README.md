==================================
There are three parts in my run_analysis.R file.

Firstly, use read.csv function to read dataset , features, activity_lables file, 
         add header to the test and train dataset, and then use cbind function to merge these two datasets.
Secondly, Use Grep for identifying the subset measures.
Thirdly, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
